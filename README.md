## About

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, neighborhood, and more. It's designed to help users understand how machine learning can be applied to real estate pricing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

   
## Usage
To use this project for house price prediction, follow the guidelines provided in the codebase. You can find examples and explanations in the project's notebooks.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing information about various houses. Details about the dataset, including its source and format, can be found in the project's data folder.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis. You can find more information in the data cleaning notebook.

## One-Hot Encoding
Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding. Details on how this encoding is performed can be found in the codebase.

## Splitting Dataset
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate machine learning models. This ensures accurate model assessment.

## Model and Accuracy
This project employs various machine learning models for house price prediction. The accuracy of these models is discussed in the notebooks and codebase.
